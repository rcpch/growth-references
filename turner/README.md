# Turner's Syndrome

The data are assumed to be normally distributed at all ages, with a constant coefficient of variation of 4.7% as reported in the paper. This constrains L to 1 and S to 0.047.

For the M curve the mean heights from 1 to 20 years (table 1 column 3) are smoothed with a natural cubic spline with six degrees of freedom, where the residual SD is 1.1 cm.
