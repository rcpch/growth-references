# Growth and other References

- A repository for all Growth References, internationally. The UK references are only useable under MRC license. The WHO or CDC data are freely available open data.

- This is not an exhaustive list but the aim is to be a repository for all LMS references, not only for growth but for all other physiological parameters.

- We welcome submissions to the repository to build the collection - please send pull requests or contact us on growth.digital@rcpch.ac.uk.

- We are working on a 'standard format' of JSON that will contain reference metadata as well as the LMS tables themselves, in a 'key-value' format that makes programmatic lookups safe and reliable. Along with the data file, we request the following: file name, parameters described, acknowledgement text, authors, publication / reference.

1. Average values at birth for weight, length and head circ for all term births (gestations 37+0 to 42+6 weeks) computed from UK 1990 reference database.

2. Weight, and head circ at birth, by gestation from 23 to 43 weeks and length at birth from 26 to 43 weeks, computed from UK 1990 reference data base and shown by week.

3. This is the WHO standard for weight, BMI and head circ from 2 weeks to 4 years, for length 2 weeks to 2 years and height 2-4 years. It is shown by week to 13 weeks and then by calendar month. It is exactly the same data as the LMS data included in the Z score tables accessed from the WHO website [WHO](http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards) except there is no birthweight.

# To be added

9.  **LMSdata_BP** systolic & diastolic blood pressure for ages 4 to 24 yr.
